          SkoHub supports a novel approach for finding content on the web. It allows to follow specific subjects in order to be notified when new content about that subject is published. This is done by putting Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS, sometimes also called "controlled vocabularies") online according to the <a href="">SKOS</a> standard. Additionally, they are exposed using the (social) networking protocols ActivityPub &amp; Linked Data Notifications. This effectively turns the published vocabularies into hubs that provide structured metadata about and links to web content in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project has four deliverables. The core is the back end infrastructure for publishing vocabularies on the web (Skohub Vocabs) and for receiving and pushing notifications (SkoHub PubSub). Additionally, we provide an editor to describe web resources according to a common metadata schema and to send notifications (SkoHub Editor). The editor can also be used as a browser plugin for Firefox and Chrome (SkoHub Extension).

                SkoHub Pubsub provides the SkoHub core infrastructure, setting up basic inboxes for subjects plus the ability of subscribing to push subscriptions for each new notification.

              This part of the project covers the need to easily publish a controlled vocabulary as a SKOS file, with a basic lookup API and a nice HTML view including links to an inbox for each subject. Also, each subject is exposed as an ActivityPub actor in order to be used with SkoHub Pubsub.
